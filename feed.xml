        <title>Introduction of the Blog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, I’m Ting-Ting, an engineering student and I currently live in the United States. I open this &lt;em&gt;Wander Wondering&lt;/em&gt; blog to share with you some things I enjoyed, like my trips, my paintings, my cat Hikikomori and other fun things I have done or I planned to do. You will have fun reading my posts!
Last but not the least, since I have studied optical physics for over 10 years, I would like to share with you some interesting facts about optical physics! e.g. rainbows, lasers, why the sky is blue and why the sunset is red?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;post-1--hikikomori&quot;&gt;Post 1 : Hikikomori&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hikikomori arrived at home on Dec 1st, 2016. Daddy and mommy named her Hikikomori because we watched a documentary on YouTube about the Hikikomori phenomenon in Japan two days before we picked her up from humane society. The definition of Hikikomori in Wiki is this: The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare defines hikikomori as people who refuse to leave their house and thus isolate themselves from society in their homes for a period exceeding six months. In our case, we know that house cats are supposed to stay inside to decrease the possibility of getting lost, hitting by cars, chasing by dogs, or attacking by bugs, which means that house cats are supposed to be Hikikomori. So, we named her Hikikomori.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jekyll-instagram-portfolio-theme/web-dist/images/hikikomori-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;so furry!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hikikomori has been with us for a month, and for most of the time, she is a super well-behaved girl. She actually likes staying inside maybe due to the influence of her name. We have taken her out twice with a leash and the trips went well unexpectedly. Hikikomori likes sleeping, making gu gu sound instead of meow meow, jumping and playing with fake birds and mices. Hikikomori also likes waking Daddy and Mommy up by running to our bedroom immediately after the alarm sounds, and then leaking our face with her little tough tongue. She may consider being a morning alarm to be her job. HAHA. You will find the posts about Hikikomori interesting and amusing if you are a cat lover or animal lover!&lt;/p&gt;
